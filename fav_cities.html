                                Gilgit-Baltistan (Urdu : گلگت بلتستان), formerly known as the Northern Areas is the 
                                northernmost political entity under the administrative control of Pakistan. According 
                                to Pakistan's constitution, Gilgit-Baltistan is an autonomous region separate from Pakistan 
                                itself, and its inhabitants have never had any representation in Pakistan's parliament.

                                    Three mountain ranges meet here — the Karakoram,
                                    the Himalaya, and the Hindu Kush — and the area is a
                                    "mountain paradise" for mountaineers, trekkers, and
                                    tourists. The region has some of the world's highest
                                    mountains, including five peaks over 8,000 meters, 
                                    many over 7,000, and the largest glaciers outside the
                                        polar region. For comparison, neither Western Europe
                                        nor the lower 48 US states have anything that reaches
                                        5,000 m, nothing anywhere in Russia or North America
                                        is over 6250, and the highest peak of the Andes is just under 7000.

                                Gilgit, now the administrative center of this region,
                                was an important city on the Silk Road through which Buddhism was spread
                                from India to the rest of Asia. A large number of Sanskrit Buddhist texts,
                                including the long version of the Heart Sutra have been unearthed in Gilgit.
                                The Dards and Cizinas also appear in many of the old Pauranic lists of peoples, 
                                with the former finding mention in Ptolemy's accounts of the region. Two famous 
                                travellers, Faxian and Hsuan Tsang, are known to have traversed Gilgit as per their accounts.
                                The old Silk Road route through Gilgit is now the Karakoram Highway (KKH).
