                                Elon Musk co-founded and leads Tesla, SpaceX,

                                As the co-founder and CEO of Tesla, 
                                Elon leads all product design, 
                                engineering and global manufacturing of the company's electric vehicles,
                                battery products and solar energy products.

                                Since the company’s inception in 2003,
                                Tesla’s mission has been to accelerate the world’s
                                transition to sustainable energy. The first Tesla
                                product, the Roadster sports car, debuted in 2008, 
                                followed by the Model S sedan, which was introduced in 2012
                                , and the Model X SUV, which launched in 2015. Model S received 
                                Consumer Reports’ Best Overall Car and has been named the Ultimate
                                Car of the Year by Motor Trend, while Model X was the first SUV
                                ever to earn 5-star safety ratings in every category and sub-category
                                in the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s tests.
                                In 2017, Tesla began deliveries of Model 3, a mass-market electric
                                vehicle with more than 320 miles of range, and unveiled Tesla Semi
                                , which is designed to save owners at least $200,000 over a million
                                miles based on fuel costs alone. In 2019, Tesla unveiled Cybertruck,
                                which will have better utility than a traditional truck and more
                                performance than a sports car, as well as the Model Y compact SUV,
                                which began customer deliveries in early 2020.

                                Tesla also produces three energy storage products
                                , the Powerwall home battery, the Powerpack commercial-scale battery,
                                and Megapack, which is designed for utility-scale installations.
                                In 2016, Tesla became the world’s first vertically-integrated
                                sustainable energy company with the acquisition of SolarCity,
                                the leading provider of solar power systems in the United States,
                                and in 2017 released Solar Roof – a beautiful and affordable energy generation product.

                                As lead designer at SpaceX, Elon oversees the development of
                                rockets and spacecraft for missions to Earth orbit and
                                ultimately to other planets. In 2008, the SpaceX Falcon
                                1 was the first privately developed liquid fuel rocket
                                to reach orbit, and SpaceX made further history in 2017
                                by re-flying both a Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon spacecraft
                                for the first time. Soon after, Falcon Heavy, the most 
                                powerful operational rocket in the world by a factor of 
                                two, completed its first flight in 2018. In 2019, SpaceX’s 
                                crew-capable version of the Dragon spacecraft completed its 
                                first demonstration mission, and the company will fly NASA 
                                astronauts to the International Space Station for the first 
                                time in 2020. Building on these achievements, SpaceX is developing 
                                Starship – a fully reusable transportation system that will carry 
                                crew and cargo to the Moon, Mars and beyond ­– and Starlink, which 
                                will deliver high speed broadband internet to locations where access 
                                has been unreliable, expensive, or completely unavailable. By pioneering 
                                reusable rockets, SpaceX is pursuing the long-term goal of making humans 
                                a multi-planet species by creating a self-sustaining city on Mars.

                                soul-crushing urban congestion and enable high-speed, long-distance travel.
                                The Boring Company built a 1.15 mile R&D tunnel in Hawthorne,
