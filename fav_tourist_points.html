                        K2, Chinese Qogir Feng, also called Mount Godwin Austen,
                        called locally Dapsang or Chogori, the world’s second highest pea
                        k (28,251 feet [8,611 metres]), second only to Mount Everest. K2
                        is located in the Karakoram Range and lies partly in a Chinese-
                        administered enclave of the Kashmir region within the Uygur Autonomous
                        Region of Xinjiang, China, and partly in the Gilgit-Baltistan portion
                        of Kashmir under the administration of Pakistan.

                        The glacier- and snow-covered mountain rises from its base at about 15,000 feet
                        (4,570 metres) on the Godwin Austen Glacier, a tributary of the Baltoro
                        Glacier. The mountain was discovered in 1856 by Col. T.G. Montgomerie 
                        of the Survey of India, and it was given the symbol K2 because it was 
                        the second peak measured in the Karakoram Range. 
                        The name Mount Godwin Austen is for the peak’s first surveyor, Col. H.H. 
                        Godwin Austen, a 19th-century English geographer

                        The first attempt to reach the summit was made 
                        by an Anglo-Swiss expedition in 1902 that ascended
                        to 18,600 feet (5,670 metres) on the peak’s northeastern
                        crest. Other unsuccessful attempts included an Italian 
                        expedition in 1909, led by Luigi Amedeo, duke d’Abruzzi, 
                        via the southeastern ridge (later called the Abruzzi Ridge) 
                        that reached approximately 20,000 feet (6,100 metres). In 1938 
                        an American expedition led by Charles Houston via the Abruzzi
                        Ridge reached about 26,000 feet (7,925 metres); in 1939 another
                        American-led expedition following the same route reached about 
                        27,500 feet (8,380 metres); and in 1953 another expedition led
                        by Houston reached 25,900 feet (7,900 metres) on the Abruzzi 
                        Ridge. Finally, in 1954, an Italian expedition consisting of 
                        five scientists (including the geologist Ardito Desio as leader)
                        , a doctor, a photographer, and 12 others, including a Pakistani,
                        managed to conquer the Abruzzi Ridge despite the severe weather 
                        conditions. The summit was reached at 6 PM on July 31, 1954, by 
                        Achille Compagnoni and Lino Lacedelli. In the course of the ascent,
                        Mario Puchoz, one of the guides, died of pneumonia.

                        K2's height given on maps and encyclopedias 
                        is 8,611 metres (28,251 ft). In the summer of 
                        2014, a Pakistani-Italian expedition to K2, named
                        "K2 60 Years Later", was organized to commemorate 
                        the 60th anniversary of the first ascent of K2. One
                        of the goals of the expedition was to accurately measure
                        the height of the mountain using satellite navigation. 
                        The height of K2 measured during this expedition was 8,609.02
                        metres (28,244.8 ft)
